# Sound Files Directory

This directory should contain audio files for distraction sounds during the competition.

Suggested audio files:
- beep.mp3 - Simple beep sound
- distraction1.mp3 - Random noise
- distraction2.mp3 - Musical note
- distraction3.mp3 - Funny sound effect

Note: The current implementation uses Web Audio API to generate sounds programmatically,
so actual audio files are not required for basic functionality.

To add custom sounds, modify the playDistraction() function in script.js to use:
const audio = new Audio('/static/sounds/filename.mp3');
audio.play();
